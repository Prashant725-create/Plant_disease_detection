# Plant_disease_detection
Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify diseases in plant leaves. It uses the ResNet-50 architecture, a powerful pre-trained model known for its high accuracy in image classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of diseased and healthy plant leaf images, validated with a separate set for tuning, and finally tested to evaluate its performance.

The project also includes a user-friendly interface that connects the backend (built using a server-side script) with a simple frontend. Once the backend is executed, the server listens on a specified port and handles requests from the frontend, allowing users to upload images and receive predictions in real time.

Currently, the Jupyter notebook is configured to run within a UV virtual environment. However, this can be easily adjusted by modifying a few lines of code if a different environment is used.
